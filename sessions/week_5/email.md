**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 5 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Five.

It's time to chill out and consider the assessment.

This week, for those in attendance, I will be showing some of last years model projects.

Further to this, you will work in groups to develop a problem statement. A good problem statement can frame a project.

My only request for, this week, is that you start to consider the problem you will be solving for the assessment. With hope, some of you will share your ideas with me.

[You may want to revisit the assessment](https://joeappleton18.github.io/advanced-database-systems-2021/sessions/assessment_1_project%20with%20individual%20report_brief.html#assessment-1-project-with-report-due-friday-14th-january-2022).

All the best,
	
Joe
